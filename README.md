# Snake

In this mini project i have used the Point Interface which is the based abstraction in it.
- Everything is presented as a point on the Console. (X, Y) or (Row, Column) :
* Using multidimential array the field is created.
* The Snake itself is presented like Queue of Points.
* Food is also single point on the console.
